Guide for implementing cron jobs in Ubuntu to perform automatic tasks. The following is for automated
game database backups that occur every 3 hours.


sudo su (become root)

crontab -e (will prompt for editor choice, I like nano so I pick 1)

Paste the following at the bottom:

0 */3 * * * make -C /home/YOUR_USER/Game backup
(Save and exit (ctrl+x and y)

“At minute 0 past every 3rd hour.” 

Make sure you have edited "/home/YOUR_USER/Game/.env" with the database (openrsc_game) as well as your
created MariaDB SQL user and password. The make command refers to a Makefile in the Game directory that
reads environment variables from the hidden .env file in the Game directory.

You can test out crontab scheduling using: https://crontab.guru

If successful, a zip file should appear in the "/home/YOUR_USER/Game/data" directory. Example:

root@MariaDB:/home/wolf/Game/data# ls -ls
total 15020
15016 -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 15373449 Mar  7 22:11 20190307-2211-EST.zip
    4 drwxrwxrwx 3 root root     4096 Mar  2 11:35 db



For clearing out database backups older than 7 days (these will grow in size over time and eventually use the entire disk otherwise)
0 23 * * * make -C /home/YOUR_USER/Game clear-old-backups

“At 23:00.”

Example crontab -e under "sudo su" root user:

0 */3 * * * make -C /home/wolf/Game backup-openrsc
0 */3 * * * make -C /home/wolf/Game backup-cabbage
0 23 * * * make -C /home/wolf/Game clear-old-backups
