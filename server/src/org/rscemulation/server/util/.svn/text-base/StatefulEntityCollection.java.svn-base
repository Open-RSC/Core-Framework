 * This class is a collection which is backed by 3 seperate Sets.

 * These sets control the state of this collection.
 *
 * To update this collections current state,
 * you need to explicity call the update method.
 *
 * The purpose of this collection is to seperate new values added to
 * this collection untill the update method has been called. Removal
 * of entities will NOT take effect until the update method is called.
 * This is so we can see what is being removed (and in cases this is
 * required by the server) to handle them specially.
