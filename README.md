## Project Information<a name="general"></a>
The original RuneScape Classic was closed down and abandoned after 17 years on August 6th, 2018. Through open source black box reverse engineering, the Open RuneScape Classic project team have brought forth Open RuneScape Classic (Open RSC) so that it may be enjoyed by fans once again. In this repository is everything needed to run the closest to authentic version of RuneScape Classic available. There are still issues to address but efforts are continually ongoing to fix them. This project has been built upon the efforts of the RuneScape Classic private server developer community spanning from 2008 to 2018. From the inception of the Open RSC project in June 2018, the team has reviewed thousands of hours of RSC+ replays to ensure an accurate and authentic in-game experience. We have rewritten the core server framework and expanded it to scale far beyond the original abilities of the original RuneScape Classic game. Included are several server configurations that allow many new game features to be activated without needing to change any code. Example: Runecrafting, running, custom sprites, faster game speeds, higher experience rates, new quests, auction house, clans, parties, pets, and so much more. We primarily use Discord to stay in touch and welcome anyone that would like to learn and help contribute code to the project. We host free to play public worlds as well - see our website for more information. One last thing: we do not accept any monetary donations whatsoever. This is a hobby and will only ever be a hobby. We don't believe anyone should profit using somebody else's work, even if it is considered abandonware.


## How to Play<a name="play"></a>
<b>Run your own server:</b>

Download <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/#section=mac">IntelliJ IDEA Community</a> and <a href="https://downloads.mariadb.org/">MariaDB (MySQL) server</a>.

The Open RuneScape Classic project team suggests that before hosting a public server, developers learn the ins and outs of everything by running the game locally first.
